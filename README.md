## 🤔 What is `ZeidLab.ToolBox` Library?

**ZeidLab.ToolBox** is a versatile and robust utility library designed to simplify common programming tasks, enhance error handling, and promote functional programming paradigms in C#. It provides a collection of tools and extensions that streamline operations such as null checks, error handling, task management, and railway-oriented programming (ROP) sometimes known as "Result Pattern".

### 🎁 Features

* **Unit Type:** A type representing the absence of a meaningful value, useful in functional programming.
* **Maybe Type:** A monadic type for handling optional values, similar to Option in functional languages.
* **Result Type:** A robust error-handling type for railway-oriented programming, allowing chaining of operations with explicit success and failure states.
* **Error Handling:** Structured error handling with ResultError,supporting error codes, messages, and exceptions.
* **Asynchronous Support:** Comprehensive support for asynchronous operations with Result types.

Inspired by [LanguageExt](https://github.com/louthy/language-ext), this library offers a more compact and user-friendly alternative with extensive examples and tutorials.
